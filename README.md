# Bank tech test

Today, you'll practice doing a tech test.

For most tech tests, you'll essentially have unlimited time.  This practice session is about producing the best code you can when there is a minimal time pressure.

You'll get to practice your OO design and TDD skills.

You'll work alone, and you'll also review your own code so you can practice reflecting on and improving your own work.

## Specification

### Requirements

* You should be able to interact with your code via a REPL like IRB or the JavaScript console.  (You don't need to implement a command line interface that takes input from STDIN.)
* Deposits, withdrawal.
* Account statement (date, amount, balance) printing.
* Data can be kept in memory (it doesn't need to be stored to a database or anything).

### Acceptance criteria

**Given** a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012  
**And** a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012  
**And** a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012  
**When** she prints her bank statement  
**Then** she would see

```
date || credit || debit || balance
14/01/2012 || || 500.00 || 2500.00
13/01/2012 || 2000.00 || || 3000.00
10/01/2012 || 1000.00 || || 1000.00
```

## Implementation

- deposits and withdrawals will both act on balance -> closely linked
- Account statement acts upon transaction data: (date, amount, balance)

Two classes: Bank (transactions, bankStatement) and Card (balance, deposit, withdraw)

Rough user stories

- card starts with balance 0
- user can deposit money to card
- user can only withdraw an amount < than current balance, otherwise throws an error
- After a successful deposit or withdrawal, card stores transaction history (date, deb or cred/ balance after)

- bank class stores instances of card class
- bank generates a user's statement using their instance of card
- statement is generated in reverse chronological order.
